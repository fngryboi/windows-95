I'm a firm believer of the following:

- You should always strive to learn new things
- Necessity is the mother of invention
- Don't forget to have fun and enjoy it

During the day I work as a web developer, during the nights I mostly tinker with various projects (ranging from hardware modifications to game development and everything in-between) that I sometimes write about [here](/).
