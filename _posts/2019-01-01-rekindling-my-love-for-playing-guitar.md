title: Rekindling My Love For Playing Guitar

I loved playing the guitar when I was in my teens, but somewhere along the line I dropped that and went on to do other things. I think that my creative outlets in general shifted drastically from doing art and music towards programming and game development.

But as my university studies has come to an end and I've been left with a whole summer with essentially nothing to do until I start working my first real job in September, I felt that one of the things I should try to do is pick up the guitar again.

But the reason that I decided to turn it into a blog post is because I've spent some time doing some self reflections as to the reasons to why I quit playing in the first place. And I thought others might find some truths in my experience, or at least feel inclined to perhaps do some self reflections of their own to overcome their "demons" or obstacles.

## Crutches of the past

I used to take guitar lessons by a great teacher, at first with a one on one lessons which I later started having with a friend of mine.  But quickly it turned from being a good fun time to spend time with my buddy into feeling like I lagged behind, he's a talented guy who learned quick and spent hours of his free time practicing. Whilst I just played for fun and didn't spend as much time practicing and as such I didn't progress as fast, which at the time made me feel discouraged to a certain degree seeing how well he played. He also had some fancy guitars which made me jealous, although he 'd definitely earned them given how well he played. Luckily I got to play them whenever we hung out after school üòÅ.

Second crutch for me was and still is at the time of writing this the music theory. Back then I was only interested in learning how to play certain songs that I was into at the time, but I had no interest in music theory. Which I now realize has held me back this whole time, because knowing music theory makes you understand what notes sound good together. Not only that, it also forms the foundation for improvising because you have a framework to work from.

And lastly, something that holds true more so now than back then. I don't have any amplifiers or pedals anymore, instead I'm just using a free version of a guitar modeling program with an affordable audio interface that I plug in the guitar to. Luckily I haven't sold of any guitars of mine, a lesson my dad taught me as he explained that selling his guitars when he was young were one of his regrets ([a reassuring message to my guitars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)). Something that has allowed me to keep learning how to play some songs but it isn't something that inspires me to play as it's a hassle to set it all up and get up and running.

## Starting fresh

The first step of my journey was to get a basic setup of effect pedals and an amplifier. And although getting a big Marshall stack with a 4x12" speaker cabinet and a 50W amp head isn't beyond the realm of reach for me (at least if I go with the new [Origin line-up](https://marshall.com/marshall-amps/products/amps/origin/origin50h)), I don't feel deserving of it just yet üòÖ.

Instead I opted for something a little more sane, but something that will give me a solid upgrade path down the line as I feel more confident that I could go with bigger and badder amplifiers.

The Vox AC10C1 combo amplifier, which is [a solid 10W tube amplifier](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RrQ3BPzGNzI) that will easily meet my needs. The amplifier has a 16 Ohm speaker cabinet output, which serves great as a future upgrade path where you can add a speaker cabinet for an even bigger sound. That speaker cabinet can then be the basis for other amp heads later down the line.

Of course I need some effect pedals to get some cool and [fun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aveUEZkcQno) effects out of it, and my main priorities here is to start out with just a few pedals. But a good selection of pedals that will give me a versatile pedal board. This is where I think most of my enjoyment will come from. The pedals I had when I was younger were functional, but weren't particularly well made (in terms of construction or tone).

The pedals I ended up with are the MojoMojo from TC Electronics for the Overdrive tones (which Paul Gilbert [loves](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Le4wL362MVU)), LA Submachine by MXR for some [octavia-fuzz tones](https://youtu.be/pB-bqcmE-mg?t=842), Dispatch Master by Earthquaker Devices for some chimey [delay /reverb](https://youtu.be/D4dD-UwwDd8?t=914) and lastly a tuner pedal for convenience.
