## Project Management Tool

It's been a long time since I posted here, haven't been active on the interwebs because school is underway and I'm currently studying hard for midterms exams. But I thought I'd take a short break by dusting off this blog and write a new post.

As this school year started I decided to pick up an old VR project and go over it, decide if I could salvage any of it or scrap it and start fresh, eventually I opted to scrap it completely - a ton of work that I just abandoned to start fresh.

Why? Because my workflow sucked, leaving me with half-finished code and badly handled notes and comments related to it (some outdated, others no longer relevant).

Before I even open up Unreal Engine and start a new project I decided that I had to make a better workflow for myself. Previously I had relied on notes and a big textfile containing everything that was worked on, what was implemented and what I wanted to implement. Which eventually built up into what would seem like a big, messy and phlegm-filled hairball.

So instead of that I needed a tool which could keep everything organized, so I went back to something we used for the first game-project in school, Youtrack. But I disliked the interface and most of what it offers is way beyond what I need for my one-man projects. Shortly after, by pure happenstance I found a retweet on my Twitter feed that Trello was getting a desktop app. So I looked up what Trello was and made awkward high-pitched happy sounds, with a big grin that would cut my head off in half if it weren't for my ears. Just for future reference, I get super weird whenever I stumble upon cool tech or software that I can have great use of. Trello was basically Google Keep - but on steroids, and tacos (high-five to you if you got that reference).

I now organize every thought or idea into cards on my Trello board, with specific lists for different categories. These are, to name a few, "Todo Mechanically", "Todo Visually", "Links" (where I always include a image link attachment so the card has a image banner above it) and "Progress". My Progress list is filled with a card for each day I work, with its description detailing what I've done that day and a comment for a rough estimate of how much time I spent. It's totally unnecessary but I find it motivating to see how much time I've spent and what I've done. I plan to make a new post here whenever I've reached 30 days to show what I've done and the time spent to accomplish it.

## Staying on track with

Now that I had all my workflow in place and have a new project going, I knew I had to stay disciplined when working with my code - otherwise it would be going the same way as my old project.

I could've layed out a bunch of ground rules for myself to follow, but I basically only needed one rule, which is:
 - I'm only working on one thing at a time, and if it doesn't work out and I move on to something else due to fatigue from whatever I worked on, or maybe because it was too difficult - I will delete everything in my code related to that and reconsider if I want to actually do it.

This way I keep all my code neat with only working parts, and I don't get distracted by being in more than one place at a time. Which works quite well because I don't have a lot of spare time to work on my project so I only get between 2-4 hours each time, with some exceptions going beyond that on weekends.

## Handling Source

Up to now I've used Github for handling my source code and versioning, and it's a great tool - but for my current project it is starting to meet Githubs limitations. Mostly with file size limitations (maximum of 100mb per file on Github, with warnings popping up when a file exceeds 50mb), I also have second thoughts about leaving my source code to 3rd parties where I'm not in control. Github is a great service but when it comes to my passion projects, I'd like to be in complete control of it.

So I'm currently looking into how to host my source code, I'd still want to use Git as it is a powerful tool. But I want to host it myself.

There's two solutions that I've found, and I'll probably end up doing both - but one will be a middle-step before implementing the other one.

I could host a Git Server on a Raspberry Pi using GitPi, which is what I'll probably be using in the short term.

The other option is to setup a home server using Amahi, and setting up a Git Server app on it - along with all other important files I want to have backed up. I don't have the means to execute this plan currently. I've been meaning to setup some form of NAS or Home Server for storage and media streaming anyway. That way I can upgrade my own system to be 100% flash storage with great speeds.

Unrelated but lately I've been watching a ton of Star Trek on Netflix, I started with the original series and I'm going from there. So until next time, live long and prosper.
