Hi! You made it, how *delightful*.

This little website is brand new, and will be a place for me to write about different development ventures that I'm right in the middle of. Which there is a very high risk might just be about game development that I'm currently learning through a University Education Program that spans 3 years where, at the time of writing this, I am in the middle of the second term.

Currently I'm working on a group project for a course called "System Development and Project 1", which is divided into two parts. One which is the theoretical part where we studied System Development, Agile Methods, Project Management and much more. The second part where I'm currently at we're making a project that we chose from a list of projects that were pitched during the first part. Where I'm in a group where we are making an Arcade Fighting game with the school as a theme, inspired from old classics like Street Fighter, Fatal Fury and Mortal Kombat.
I'm also working on other personal projects that are kind of pushed to the side for now, as school takes up so much of my time. That's also one of the reason I decided to setup a blog dedicated to my little projects, so that I could write out my ideas somewhere and track how far I get.

But firstly I have some minor tweaks to make to this website, which by the way is hosted on Github and powered by Jekyll. Using a theme called "Lagom". That I will iterate on and improve as I see fit - starting with one of my old projects that needs some more love, my "Smart Embedding Twitch.tv Player". Which was an embedded stream that only appeared if the channel was currently streaming. But in it's current state it's on the old Twitch API that I don't know if it works, and the way it checks the channel status is ineffective as it does a HTTP request with a timed interval...

Once that one is fixed I will make that repository public with a working example right here, and I'll start streaming again and giving my personal projects some love over on Twitch. For several reasons really, with most importantly a way to motivate me to work on them, but also because I'm a loud thinker and that I could potentially get some helpful input or tips as I go about.

But that's all for this time, I hope to see you around!
