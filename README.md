# Windows 98 Aesthetic Theme for Jekyll

Currently being worked on... Can be seen over on https://fngryboi.github.io
*Note: The source code here might be older than the one hosted on https://fngryboi.github.io currently as I'm ironing out the rough edges*

Inspired by PaladinAmber's stream overlay and lo-fi music streams that can be found on YouTube, initially made as a 1 day project of mine but has over time been worked on to fix various bugs and quirks.

Original theme made by h01000110 (hi): [Windows 95](https://h01000110.github.io/20170917/windows-95)
